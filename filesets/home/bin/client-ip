# Refresh the SSH_CONNECTION variable.
#
# NOTE: When a shell is loaded into a `tmux` pane, its environment is
#       given a correct, *currently valid* SSH_CONNECTION value. When
#       the client connection is reset, however, running shells DON'T
#       get an updated SSH_CONNECTION value. To refresh the value, we
#       have to ask `tmux` for the current connection info ourselves,
#       and then update the local environment variable before use.
#
#       If called from within an SSH session *from another VM*, the IP
#       reported will be *the internal IP of the calling VM*, not that
#       of the externally-connected client.
#
#       Also note despite the "export" call below, this update does not
#       actually bubble out to the calling shell, as this script is not
#       being *sourced*. The outer SSH_CONNECTION will continue to hold
#       an incorrect value.
#
#       (The `tmux status` guard prevents errors if we're not in tmux.)
