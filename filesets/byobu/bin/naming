NOTE: Byobu custom binaries are named as "N_NAME",
      where "N" is how often the script should run (in seconds)
      and "NAME" is a descriptive name for the user's own sake.

Importantly, script output is ordered on the status bar via an ALPHA sorting,
so if you want a script that runs less often (say, every 60s) to show before
a script that runs more often (say, every 30s), you can name the first "0060"
and the second "030"; this puts the 60s script before the 30s script without
unnecessarily running the operation every 29s or so.

To verify the order in which custom binaries will run, try:
/bin/ls -1 | /bin/sort | /bin/grep -P '^[0-9]'
